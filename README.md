## Laubot

What is this ? Laubot is a simple modular Telegram userbot running on Python 3.8+ with an SQLAlchemy database.
 
Based on RaphielGang's [Paperplane](https://github.com/RaphielGang/Telegram-UserBot). I forked this just for 
fun, pick some modules, and manage some group lol

## So yeah let's get started.
* [Generate String Session](https://repl.it/@launarine/sessiongen)
* [Deploy to Heroku](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/launarine/Laubot/tree/sql-extended)
